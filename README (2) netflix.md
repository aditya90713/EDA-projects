Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows

You can also download TV shows and movies to your iOS,
Android, or Windows 10 device and watch without an
internet connection. The company that started its run more than 20 years ago as a mail-order DVD rental service has since transformed its business model completely to match the ever-changing tech landscape. As a result, the company now boasts more than 200 million subscribers worldwide and secures a spot as one of the biggest media publishers in the world with its Netflix Originals program‚Ä¶
